# Simple Visitor sign-up system

## Non-Functional Requirements 

#### Design and Tool selection analysis
This application is based on MVC(Module View Controller).
* **Framework evaluation** - ExpressJS is back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js. Express is used for the simplicity and ease of the program. Many popular framework are based on express. Several popular Node.js frameworks are built on Express:MEAN, Hydra-express etc.
* **Performance** - Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features.
* **Usability** - Use and maintainance of Express is easy with myriad of utility methods and middleware.
* **Backend** - For database mongodb is used, as it is easy to integrate with express framework and also serves our minimal application.
* **Frontend** - Bootstrap is used for front-end minimalistic looks.
* **Hands-on evaluation** - Followed a tutorial on YouTube for step by step to build a login page. Use of Express framework pretty much made easy, with all built-in functions and community supports and online tutorials. Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box..   
* **Documentation** - I prefered using Markdown for documentation, because it is so intuitive, and also easy to learn. The syntax is simple and straightforward. 

## Installation Instruction

#### Technology Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 
* [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Express Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-validator)
* [Body-parser](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/body-parser.html)
* [Cookie-parser](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cookie-parser.html)
* [Session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)
* [Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport)
* [Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)
* [Flash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-flash)
* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)

Application is packaged with all the dependencies and it is captured in package.json, and installed dependency modules.
* Download the project from Github (https://github.com/Arpitha93/CSC583-Finals)
* Extract the contents.
* Start the database server from command prompt or shell.
	```sh
    mkdir C:/data/db
    cd mongodb_installpath/bin
    mongod
    ```
	
* Start the dependencies
	```sh
    cd extractedPath
    npm install
    ```
	
* Start the app server
    ```sh
    cd extractedPath
    node app.js
    ```
Server will be started, connect the server using http://localhost:5000 

## Architecture discussion
The architecture of this application is as follows: The visitor stores the database in the MongoDB which will be connected to the server side, where the serve will also be running Nodejs with Express and mongoose which provides the functionality of the database at the backend api. Passport is used to validate the Admin. Coming to the frontend, CSS and bootstrap is used for style of the page.The basic function here is, when event comes in or submit is hit, a function is called that sends a request to the serverâ€™s api (such as POST or GET) the response is then stored in the Vistors module. Which is a simple three-tier architecture.
